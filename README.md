👋 Hi, I’m @lalitkumarchauhan.

👀 I'm passionate about leveraging data-driven decision-making through Data Science, and exploring how it intersects with Machine Learning and emerging technologies.

🌱 I'm transitioning from a dynamic career in Customer Support to becoming a data professional. I'm driven by the belief that the vast and growing availability of global data holds immense potential for both immediate and long-term impact.

💞️ Currently, I'm looking to collaborate on a deep learning project and connect with like-minded professionals in the field.
